# Controller Introduction

This repository contains 3 simple implementation of controllers:
- Proportional-Integral controller 
- Repetitive controller(a baseline implementation)
- Proportional-Resonant controller

The code is very simple, so detailed explanation is only written for Proportional-Resonant controller(TODO).

I implement the controllers for control of LCL grid-connected inverters, feel free to use the code for your own application.
